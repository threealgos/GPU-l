Thank you for visiting my channel! I boosted the audio and reuploaded this video so hopefully everyone can hear me more clearly. 

How to attack the Secp256k1 (Bitcoin) curve with Pollard's Kangaroo & Vast.ai for beginners

Hello fellow person on youtube,
Apologies for anything I left out or any errors made. If anyone needs help reach out in the comment section and 
I'll do my best to help if I can.

This is my first tutorial video or any video of myself on yt! I was hesitant to post this but think its important for as many people as possible to be learning about cryptography, elliptical curves and hashing functions.

Pollard's kangaroo utilizes the pollard rho theorem to generate points on an elliptical curve based on secp256k1 
It reduces the difficulty to the square root and is the only publicly known method for 'cracking' private keys from 
the public keys. 

It has been proven effective against many puzzle transactions and is currently stuck at 2 to the 119 to 2 to the 120th power.

Brute forcing the BitCrack method has been stuck at 2 to the 63 to 2 to the 64th power!

I will leave some of the basic commands here so you may copy paste them if you desire. 
Oh and I didn't mention the distinguished points and the command -d (-d 32, -d 50 etc.)
I suggest checking out the forum linked in jean luc pons github. 

apt update
apt upgrade 
apt install git
apt install make
apt install nano
mkdir btc
cd btc 
git clone https :// github .com /JeanLucPons /Kangaroo
cd Kangaroo
nano Makefile

[edit cuda path by removing the cuda version and g++ versions as shown]
[compile the program with the command below. The number 86 is the compute cap for an RTX3090]

make gpu=1 ccap=86 all

Test your build with the following :

./kangaroo -l

this will list the cuda devices showing it has gpu support.
Next run the stock in.txt file to see that it completes the operation successfully.
Upon completion you may then modify the in.txt file to reflect the keyspace and public key of your liking.

Invoke kangaroo with this command modified to match your gpu count:

./kangaroo -gpu -gpuId 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7 -ws -w save.work -wi 3000 in.txt


There you all go I hope someone cracks 120 with this and do not use this for nefarious activities.
You will probably just waste electricity.

Feel free to share the love if it works for you =D

Oh and for anyone just learning remember the private key found by this program will be a hex number you will need to pad it to 64 bits with zeros then convert it to WIF and import it into your wallet of choice. I highly recommend utilizing Electrum. 

one love,
~sully.mane
